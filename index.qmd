## Abstract

All JoVI articles begin with a structured abstract. See **TODO** for guidance and a
template for the abstract.

## Setting up and writing a JoVI article

JoVI articles are written in Quarto. This template outlines some of the features 
that are most useful for writing academic articles in Quarto; for more visit <https://quarto.org>.

To create a JoVI article, we recommend 

## Citations and footnotes

Citations can be inserted using `[@simkin2002read]`; e.g. \[@simkin2002read\]. 
Citations for this paper are kept in `bibliography.bib` in BibTeX format.[^1] 
For more on footnotes and citations see [this Quarto documentation page](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html).

[^1]: You can also insert footnotes!

## Figures and images

Images can be included and for accessibility purposes **should always** have alt text. 
Alt text of visualizations should provide meaningful descriptions of the visualization.

``` markdown
![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions,
showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of
approximately 97% of optimal."}
```

![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions,
showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of
approximately 97% of optimal."}

You can also add captions and figure references using a `:::` block combined with
an id prefixed with `#fig-`:

``` markdown
![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions,
showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of
approximately 97% of optimal."}

Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions.
:::
```

::: {#fig-teaser}
![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions,
showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of
approximately 97% of optimal."}

Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions.
:::

Then you can refer to the above figure in text using `@fig-teaser`; for example:

Refer to @fig-teaser. For the highest-quality output, we recommend using SVG
figures if possible.

Quarto also supports more complex figure layouts and subfigures; see 
[the Quarto page on figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures-and-layout.html).
For more on cross-references, see the
[Quarto page on cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html).

## Equations

Equations can be included using LaTeX syntax:

$$
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

For more on equations, see [the corresponding section in the Quarto documentation]().
