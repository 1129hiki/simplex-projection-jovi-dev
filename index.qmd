## Abstract {.unnumbered}

All JoVI articles begin with a structured abstract. See **TODO** for guidance and a template for the abstract.

## Setting up and writing a JoVI article

JoVI articles are written in Quarto, which is a simple markdown-based text format. This template outlines some of the features that are most useful for writing academic articles in Quarto; for more visit <https://quarto.org>.

You can find the source for this article in the [journalovi/jovi-template-quarto](https://github.com/journalovi/jovi-template-quarto) repository on Github. To create a new JoVI article, we recommend following these steps:

1.  Install Quarto by following [these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html).

2.  Create a new git repository to hold your article by [forking our template repository](https://github.com/journalovi/jovi-template-quarto).

You can then edit `index.qmd` in your new repository to write your paper. There are several options for editing and rendering the paper:

1.  You can execute `quarto serve` from the commandline to render the paper to `index.html` and preview it in the browser.

2.  You can edit the paper in RStudio and render it by clicking on the *Render* button: ![](images/rstudio-render-button.png){style="max-width: 382.5px" fig.alt="Click Render in the Rstudio toolbar to render a Quarto document."}

**If you plan to use RStudio,** read more about RStudio and Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/using-rstudio.html). In particular, you should install RStudio \> version 1.5, which as of this writing requires installing the [latest "daily" version of RStudio](https://dailies.rstudio.com/). If you do, you can also enable the visual editor:

![](images/rstudio-visual-editor.png){style="max-width: 554.5px" fig.alt="Click the Settings button and then Use Visual Editor in the Rstudio toolbar to enable the visual editor."}

## Citations and footnotes

Citations can be inserted using `[@simkin2002read]`; e.g. \[@simkin2002read\]. Citations for this paper are kept in `bibliography.bib` in BibTeX format. You can also insert footnotes.[^1] Note that some traditional uses of footnotes (e.g. to include URLs) are unnecessary in JoVI, as you can (and should) instead simply link directly to the URL you want to refer to with an [inline link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links).

For more on footnotes and citations see [this Quarto documentation page](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html).


## Figures and images

Images can be included and for accessibility purposes **should always** have alt text. Alt text of visualizations should provide meaningful descriptions of the visualization.

``` markdown
![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal
payoff for 10 conditions, showing an increase over time in most
conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of
approximately 97% of optimal."}
```

![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions, showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of approximately 97% of optimal."}

You can also add captions and figure references using a `:::` block combined with an id prefixed with `#fig-`:

``` markdown
::: {#fig-teaser}
![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal
payoff for 10 conditions, showing an increase over time in most
conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of
approximately 97% of optimal."}

Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions.
:::
```

::: {#fig-teaser}
![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions, showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of approximately 97% of optimal."}

Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions.
:::

Then you can refer to the above figure in text using `@fig-teaser`; for example:

Refer to @fig-teaser. For more on cross-references, see the [Quarto page on cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html).

For the highest-quality output, we recommend using SVG figures if possible.

Quarto also contains classes for more complex figure layouts and subfigures, which we recommend using in most cases if you need more complex layouts; see [the Quarto page on figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures-and-layout.html). That said, we encourage exploration of what is possible with online article formats, and you should feel free to experiment so long as the result is archivable, accessible, and readable.

## Body text

The basic body text, header formatting, and basic tags such as links, emphasis, etc should be left as-is except in rare cases (for which you should be able to demonstrate the value of your modifications). That said, we do encourage experimentation with what is possible in this format; some possibilities that just scrath the surface include: using color or other formatting to link text content semantically with figures; using inline figures; experimenting with interactive widgets in text and figures. So long as content retains archivability, accessibility, and readability, we welcome experimentation with the format.

## Code

Quarto supports R and python code; for example:

```{r}
1 + 2
```

## Equations

Equations can be included using LaTeX syntax:

$$
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

For more on equations, see [the corresponding section in the Quarto documentation]().
